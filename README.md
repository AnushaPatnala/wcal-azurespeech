# AZURE SPEECH PLATFORM
###### _TEST SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT : V7_

### Purpose
The Microsoft Speech Platform powers speech recognition (SR) experiences (such as Cortana and Dictation) in Windows 10 and Microsoft Speech SDK devices. 

This specification describes acceptable SR performance requirements, and a test procedure in which to validate different categories of devices.  The performance requirements are limited to a set of generalized user scenarios.  Device manufacturers may elect to optimize against additional scenarios or sub-system features of their devices using the test framework provided by this specification (but not required).
